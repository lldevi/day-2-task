	we will see the Document object & Window object, their various properties & methods, along with knowing their implementation & the differences between them.

Window Object:-

	The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
  It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
  Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 
  The window is part of BOM, not DOM.Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
Syntax:-

	window.property_name;


	ex:-
		let a = 25;
		let b =30;
		
		console.log(window.a);
	
		o/p  --> 25
		

Document Object:-
	It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
 By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. 
 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
 The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
 The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
Syntax:

	document.property_name;

	ex:
		function kd() {
               let title = document.title;
              let domain = document.domain;
              let body = document.body;
	   };
		
	    console.log(document.title);
